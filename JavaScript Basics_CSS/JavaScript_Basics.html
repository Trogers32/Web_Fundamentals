                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2><br>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a 
                    small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for 
                    developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), 
                    it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

                        <span class="light">Variable Declaration</span> 
                        JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values
                        - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds 
                        a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique 
                        names are called identifiers. 
                        <span class="dark">var x;</span>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <span class="light">Variable Assignment</span> 
                        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - 
                        our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The 
                        = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. 
                        <span class="dark">var x= 10;</span>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <span class="light">Data Types</span> 
                        Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables 
                        you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript
                        primitives: Boolean - <span class="dark">true</span> or <span class="dark">false;</span> 
                        null - <span class="dark">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="dark">42</span> 
                        or <span class="dark">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="dark">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> 
                        Array - <span class="dark">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="dark">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <span class="light">Conditionals</span> 
                        When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different 
                        decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that 
                        have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. 
                        There are the following conditional states: <span class="dark">if</span> a specified 
                        condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="dark">else if</span> 
                        to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="dark">else</span> 
                        we execute this block of code;
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <span class="light">Loops</span> 
                        There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all 
                        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. 
                        Image you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you 
                        stop. That's a loop!
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <span class="light">Function</span> 
                        Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run 
                        that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting 
                        together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we 
                        screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished 
                        instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
